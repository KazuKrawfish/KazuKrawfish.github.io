<h1>Line of Command Development Diary</h1>
  <p>23JUN - An especially exciting development is the ban-list, which allows each scenario to have a custom list of buildable and banned minions. This will improve the campaign a good deal - For example, in a scenario where the player has significant starting air forces and airbases, but the ability to build more would make it too easy, all air minions will be banned from construction. </p>
  <p>08JUL - We continue to upgrade the compie's effectiveness. The most recent change was to improve its refueling method. Before it would only try to refuel an air unit when it was at 1/3 fuel, which could be dangerous since it didn't account for distance to nearest airbase. Now, the compie checks for the nearest airbase every turn, and tasks that aircraft to refuel while it still has enough fuel to make the journey. </p>
  <p>Another major functionality improvement is the stealth system. Some minions (For now only submarines, but soon to be insurgents and operatives) can only be seen when an enemy minion is adjacent to them. This is conceptually easy to achieve but it's important to double check the nuts and bolts of the game mechanics to make sure there aren't any bugs that slip in with pathfinding and combat, and especially with the compie.</p>
  <p>Additionally, play-tester Socks had a laundry list of UI issues, including that he couldn't see minion attack ranges. This is a high-priority playability concern, since if a player cannot see enemy minion ranges, it's much harder to plan moves. Other criticisms were that some sprites look too similar, that the purchase-minion mechanic is confusing, and that units have to perform each action step-by-step, instead of all at once. This last one will be difficult to implement so it's low priority for now.</p>
  <p>20JUN - We recently accomplished a static build of Line of Command in Visual Studio. This was a significant roadblock for some time, as SFML must be linked with a decent number of external libs, and tracking them all down was error-prone and difficult, even though the SFML website provides excellent <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/faq.php#build-link-static">documentation on the subject</a> .</p>
  <p>You can download the latest static build <a href="https://github.com/KazuKrawfish/Line_Of_Command_Executable">here</a>. It requires the Microsoft Visual Studio Code redistributable to run, located <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170">here</a>.</p>
  <p>Other recent effort has been to update the various interfaces to make it entirely point-and-click. Previously it was using text-based input/output, which was much easier to program initially but does not look remotely like a finished product.</p>
