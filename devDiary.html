<h1>Line of Command Development Diary</h1>
 <h2>12OCT</h2>
  <p>A long-awaited function is the BattleLab, which has been a dream to reach for since the inception of Line of Command. The program now loads a config file at execution start which can kick off the BattleLab. This sub-function of the game runs a series of battles between two computer players on the same map, but tweaks some of the behavior of the second player, while leaving the first player as the "control". It records battle performance (Winner and time to win) to provide insight into the best behaviors, a crude but positive start to macine learning.</p>
 <h2>19SEP</h2>
  <p>The submarine and aircraft carrier are now both fully functional. Additionally, several tweaks were made to compie. It now attacks infantry more aggressively- more in line with how it behaved in the Advance Wars series- and attacks with hybrid minions. This allows it to fully use anti-aircraft to defend against marauding bombers.</p>

 <h2>29AUG</h2>
  <p>The campaign has been cleaned up further, with new missions added and one weaker mission removed entirely. Special rules for various faction-specific minions have been fully implemented, including splash damage, combat-capable transports, and landmines.</p>
 <h2>29JUL</h2>
  <p>Another major jump has been made, this time by adding 4 separate factions, each with a slightly tweaked set of available minions. For example, North Redonia replaces its Artillery with the Assault Gun, which has smaller range but can direct-fire if ordered, and is slightly better armored. This reflects its status as a middling-power which must make use of all available resources to build its war-machine, even when that means cutting costs. Meanwhile, South Redonia gets several high-tech units which reflects its higher industrial capacity and great wealth, while Ormosa relies on guerilla tactics using stealth-infantry and a capture-capable vehicle called the Technical. Finally, the ponderous but mighty Torran fields Super-Heavy Armor and Victory Rocket systems in concert with anachronistic cavalry formations.</p>

 <h2>08JUL</h2> 
  <p>We continue to upgrade the compie's effectiveness. The most recent change was to improve its refueling method. Before it would only try to refuel an air unit when it was at 1/3 fuel, which could be dangerous since it didn't account for distance to nearest airbase. Now, the compie checks for the nearest airbase every turn, and tasks that aircraft to refuel while it still has enough fuel to make the journey. </p>
  <p>Another major functionality improvement is the stealth system. Some minions (For now only submarines, but soon to be insurgents and operatives) can only be seen when an enemy minion is adjacent to them. This is conceptually easy to achieve but it's important to double check the nuts and bolts of the game mechanics to make sure there aren't any bugs that slip in with pathfinding and combat, and especially with the compie.</p>
  <p>Additionally, play-tester Socks had a laundry list of UI issues, including that he couldn't see minion attack ranges. This is a high-priority playability concern, since if a player cannot see enemy minion ranges, it's much harder to plan moves. Other criticisms were that some sprites look too similar, that the purchase-minion mechanic is confusing, and that units have to perform each action step-by-step, instead of all at once. This last one will be difficult to implement so it's low priority for now.</p>
 <h2>23JUN</h2>
  <p>An especially exciting development is the ban-list, which allows each scenario to have a custom list of buildable and banned minions. This will improve the campaign a good deal - For example, in a scenario where the player has significant starting air forces and airbases, but the ability to build more would make it too easy, all air minions will be banned from construction. </p> 
 <h2>20JUN</h2>
  <p>We recently accomplished a static build of Line of Command in Visual Studio. This was a significant roadblock for some time, as SFML must be linked with a decent number of external libs, and tracking them all down was error-prone and difficult, even though the SFML website provides excellent <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/faq.php#build-link-static">documentation on the subject</a> .</p>
  <p>You can download the latest static build <a href="https://github.com/KazuKrawfish/Line_Of_Command_Executable">here</a>. It requires the Microsoft Visual Studio Code redistributable to run, located <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170">here</a>.</p>
  <p>Other recent effort has been to update the various interfaces to make it entirely point-and-click. Previously it was using text-based input/output, which was much easier to program initially but does not look remotely like a finished product.</p>
