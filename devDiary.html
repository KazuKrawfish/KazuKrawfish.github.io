<h1>Line of Command Development Diary</h1>
  <p>20JUN - We recently accomplished a static build of Line of Command in Visual Studio. This was a significant roadblock for some time, as SFML must be linked with a decent number of external libs, and tracking them all down was error-prone and difficult, even though the SFML website provides excellent <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/faq.php#build-link-static">documentation on the subject</a> .</p>
  <p>You can download the latest static build <a href="https://github.com/KazuKrawfish/Line_Of_Command_Executable">here</a>. It requires the Microsoft Visual Studio Code redistributable to run, located <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170">here</a>.</p>
  <p>Other recent effort has been to update the various interfaces to make it entirely point-and-click. Previously it was using text-based input/output, which was much easier to program initially but does not look remotely like a finished product.</p>
