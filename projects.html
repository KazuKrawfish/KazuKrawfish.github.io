<h1>Current Projects</h1>
  <p>We are proud to present Line of Command, a spiritual successor to the acclaimed turn based tactical Gameboy Advance game series.</p>
  <p>Line of Command has a working computer player and a small campaign. The graphics is totally custom, 
    based on <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/">Simple Fast Media Library (SFML)</a>. </p>
  <p>We also have Map Maker, a procedural map generator for creating a grid-world with earth-like terrain and 
    outrageously named countries inhabiting it.</p>
