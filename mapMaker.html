<h1>Map Maker</h1>
<p><myLink href="https://github.com/KazuKrawfish/mapMaker">Map Maker</myLink> is a procedural map generator which creates a grid-world with Earth-like terrain. It randomly determines elevation, temperature and precipitation using random noise. It then populates that world with procedurally generated provinces and countries, each with a name more outrageous than the last.</p>
<p>Additionally, population growth and the spread of trade and technology can be tracked turn by turn. The intent is to simulate the industrial-era globalization.</p>
<p>Looking forward I would like to build in more complicated behaviors for the countries, including war and a more detailed model for economic development and exploitation of natural resources, including potentially making a single player economic/business sim. </p>
